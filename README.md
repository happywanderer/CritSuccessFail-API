# CritSuccessFail-API
A script to give effects of critical successes or failures based on weapon type or spell energy type

Type !critical and select weapon type (bludgeoning, slashing, piercing) or spell damage type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, necrotic, poison, psychic, thunder)

For example, if you swing a longsword, you'd type !critical slashing

For Fumbles, you just type !fumble and weapon or spell

So a spell fumble would be !fumble spell

Enjoy!
